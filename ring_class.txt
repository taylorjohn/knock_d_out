# Health Meters 

In order to get those nifty health meters going we need to figure out there locations

Ok, they are located at 30 pixels down from top and go down another 15 pixel to 45 pixel down

so each meter is 100 pixels wide and 15 pixel high

100 pixels works out great for figuring out amount on it!!!

# Player's Health Meter
Start's at 100
player meter starts at 175 pixel over from left side and goes to 275

# Opposite's Health Meter

# Opposite meter starts at 290 pixel over from left side and goes to 390


Stars

Number of stars starts 60 pixels over from left side and 50 pixels down from the top

Hearts

Number of stars starts 120 pixels over from left side and 50 pixels down from the top
