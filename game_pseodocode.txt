#########* PLAYER INFO STORED ############

The Player needs to store the following information and also save and reload a saved game.

I am going to create a dictionary and use repr()/eval() to convert to string and from string: '''python data = { "PLAYER":Lil Mac, "LOCATION": Bronx, NY "AGE": 13 "WEIGHT": 107 "WINS": 0 "LOSSES": 0 "KOs": 0 "RANKED": 13 "HEARTS": 0 "STARS": 0 "STAMINA": 100 "OPPENENT: 0 }

with open("data1.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as file: file.write(repr(data)) file.close() '''

Then to load:

'''python with open("data1.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file: data_string = file.readline() data = eval(data_string) print data["PLAYER"] file.close() ''

		* During between splash screen hold down space bar to get additional stamina from coach


		* In order to get those nifty Stamina meters going we need to figure out there locations
		* Ok, they are located at 30 pixels down from top and go down another 15 pixel to 45 pixel down

		* 100 pixels works out great for figuring out amount on it!!!

		* Opponent meter starts at 290 pixel over from left side and goes to 390

#########* Game Play Tips ############

	* Basic Boxing Technique

		* More of your punches will reach the opponent if you aim where he's not guarding.

		* Player won't be able to punch when he's tired (when he has no heart's), and his oppent will immediately start punching.

	* Dodge his punches and recover hearts

    		* Player left punch is a little faster than his right, but it's not quite as strong.

#########* Winning Boxing Technique ############

	* Dodge opponent's punches and then punch back immediately. You'll starle your opponent (his face will show it).
		* This is your chance --- punch furiously and you should score.

    	* If your opponent comes up on the count of 1 after you've knocked hm down, go with a uppercut for a sure knock-down.

    	* During an interval: Use the advice of the trainer/coach to your best advantage.
