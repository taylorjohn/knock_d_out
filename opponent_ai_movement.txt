Ranked #2: Glass Joe (5000 Points needed)

Glass Joe is simple. 

For the first 40 seconds, he will just stand there. 

Start by punching him in the face until he starts to
block. Then, aim for his gut. 

Repeat this until the timer hits 40 seconds. 

He will then jump back, taunt you, then jump forward and
start attacking. 

This is when you want to hit him. If you manage to
do this. Then he should go down. 


If he gets up, wait for him to flash
before you dodge his punch. Keep punching him in the face until he
starts blocking. 

He goes down really easily, so you should have no
problems at all.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranked #1: Von Kaiser (8000 Points needed)

Von Kaiser is also easy, but only a little tougher. 


You have to wait until he shakes his head back and forth until you dodge him. 

Or you
can wait until he raises his gloves before you hit him in the gut to
try to get a star. Eventually, he will try some uppercuts. Just dodge
these and you can get a lot of hits on him. Keep this up and you will
be up against the minor circuit champ shortly.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor Circuit Champion: Piston Honda (Title bout, must KO or TKO)

Man, I used to have a problem with this guy, at least until I got the
blocking thing down. When you start, wait until you see his eyebrows
twitch until you dodge. He will also use some hooks that are pretty
easy to spot. Later, he will leap back, sidestep around for a few
seconds, and then rush forward to hit you with his devastating piston
rush. Either punch him in the gut when he runs toward you, or block 5
punches he throws, then retaliate. Eventually, he should be down,
and there will be a new minor circuit champion.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Major Circuit

What to expect: Alright, you seem to be getting the hang of dodging and
blocking. In this circuit, you are going to have to memorize your foes
attack patterns real fast if you want to get through this circuit.
Just relax and pay attention to your foes movements.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranked #3: Don Flamenco (10000 Points needed)

Flamenco will just stand there taunting you. Are you going to just
stand there and take that? NO! If you attempt to hit him, he will
block and attempt to counter your punch. Dodge his punch and you will
be able to hit him a lot. He will just do this the whole match, so
counter-punching will be easy. When you knock him down. he will
attempt to hit you with a fast uppercut. Just dodge this or hit him
in the gut and continue the match. After a minute or so, Flamenco
should be defeated as long as you keep hitting him.

Sent in by Chris Huff:
You can defeat don flamenco the first time you meet him by making
him swing at you, dodging, then alternating left and right high
punches... just hold down up on the d-pad, then push
left,right,left,right,left...until his stamina is all the way
down. Repeat if necessary, but usually he's down and out the
first knockdown.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranked #2: King Hippo (Must KO)

This is another guy I had a problem with. King Hippo will do some some
jabs. Dodge, but don't fight back. Wait for him to jump in the air
with his mouth open. Hit him in the mouth before he hits you. Time it
right, and his shorts will fall off. Hit him in his gut 8 times
before he pulls his shorts up. When he falls, he won't get up.
Talk about an easy win.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranked #1: Great Tiger (10000 Points needed)

When you start the match, notice all the hearts you have. You probably
won't even need half of them. They're still good to have for
the following strategy.

Great Tiger will start with a few jabs. Watch his turban. When the
gem in the middle of his turban flashes, get ready to block, and get
5 hits on him. When he starts to do uppercuts, watch the way he
leans. If he leans left, hit him with a left, and vice-versa.
You will get some quick & easy stars this way. When you see him leap
back and start to disappear, get ready to block 5 magic punches.
After blocking 5 in a row, he will stop and have a dazed look
on his face. Hurry up and hit him in the face to knock him down.
Eventually, Great Tiger will stay down, and you will be
up against the champ.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Major Circuit Champion: Bald Bull (Title bout, must KO or TKO)

When I first saw this guy, I was surprised at how big this guy was. But
you know what they say, the bigger they are, the harder
they fall.(Unless he beats you, then it's the smaller they are,
the faster they fall)

Here we go. When you start, Hurry and hit him 2 times in the face for
a quick star. Then, watch out when he spins his gloves, this will
signal a jab. Counter punching won't stun him, so wait until he moves
his gloves up and down, as this signals a hook. You can now stun him
and get 3 hits on him now. Very soon, he will start throwing some
fast uppercuts, dodge these and you can get many more hits on him.
Eventually, he will crouch down and back up. This is the
bull charge. when he start hopping toward you, wait until he hops for
the third time, then hit him in the gut. If you timed it right,
he will be on the floor in seconds, if not, then he will have hit
you. If he does so happen to hit you, don't give up.
Keep doing this, and Bald Bull will lose not only the match,
but the major circuit title.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
World Circuit

What to expect: Nice work getting this far. The world circuit is
tough, so you are going to have to stay completely focused on your
opponent's movements if you want to succeed since no one flashes
anymore. Also, you are going to see some familiar faces in the first
few matches in this circuit.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranked #5: Piston Honda (3000 Points needed)

You're going to be up against Piston Honda again. Not to worry, he is
still easy although his moves are slightly different. When you start
the match, just wait. Eventually, he will twitch his eyebrows like he
used to. Get ready to dodge 3 jabs. After the jabs, he will do some
uppercuts. These are pretty easy to dodge. When a minute passes, he
will do his piston rush, only he won't dance around like he used to.
If you can hit him when he runs back to you, you will probably
KO him. If not, then don't worry; just keep going until you beat him.
The match may have to be won by split decision, since you can't get
many good hits on him. Just keep punching and you should do well.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranked #4: Soda Popinski (10000 Points needed)
 
Did you know that Soda Popinski was supposed to be called
Vodka Drunkenski? Nintendo thought that would be offensive towards
Russians, so they changed his name. But he still had his quotes left
unchanged. This game was made around the cold war, so Nintendo didn't
want to tick off any Russians with the whole drunk
Russian stereotype thing.

Ok, Soda Pop will start with some hooks. You get 6 hits for dodging
these. Eventually, he will do some uppercuts. You can actually try to
block and he will freeze for a brief moment. Do a quick jab when he's
crouched down to get a star. Hurry up and use this to knock him down.
You can do this 2 times before he starts dodging uppercuts. Pretty
soon he will do a little "dance". When he does this, this means he
will do 3 jabs in a row, which will hurt if you are hit. He usually 
only does this when you run out of hearts.

I should warn you that sometimes Popinski likes to sucker punch you 
without any warning. He will do one of his jabs as if he did his dance. 
He won’t flash or anything, so you have to watch for him to try for a 
jab. It’s pretty sudden, so you might end up getting hit. It doesn’t do 
much damage though. 

Beating Popinski is easy, as long as you keep your thumb on
the left or right control pad button.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranked #3: Bald Bull (7000 Points needed)

If you thought this guy was a pain before, then you are mistaken my
friend. Bald Bull fights the same as before, except the only way you
can knock him down is by an uppercut or a well-timed jab when he is
attempting his infamous bull charge. Also, the only way to get stars
is to wait for him to wave his gloves up and down and punch him
in the gut. Just repeat the strategy as if you were facing him in
the major circuit.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranked #2: Don Flamenco (5000 Points needed)

Oh wow, Flamenco actually tries to hit you in this fight. He is still
very easy to bring down.

Flamenco fights just like Glass Joe, but only a little bit faster.
He will start with jabs. Dodge these, and you get 4 hits on him.
He also does hooks, which you can get 2 hits on him. Soon enough, he
will resort to his taunting technique. It's the same thing, only you
may have to punch multiple times until you bait him into punching.
Just keep dodging and countering until he is down.

Oh, and a quick note. If the match goes on to the final round, then
he will do jabs and hooks again, so try not to let the match drag
on for too long.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranked #1: Mr. Sandman (Must KO or TKO)

Alright. This guy fights like Bald Bull, only he is much faster and
much more aggravating to box than Bald Bull. He does the same
routine as Bald Bull, except he does not uppercut like him.

When you start, get ready to dodge some fast jabs. You can punch after
he jabs, but he may block and counterpunch If you are too late.
He also is fast when it comes to hooks. When you dodge these, you only
hit him in the head once, then hit him in the gut 3 times.
When he stops punching, he may try a 3 uppercut combo. If you dodge
all 3, hit him in the face, then you can get a whopping 15 hits
on his gut. This will probably knock him down if he is below half his
stamina. You can beat Sandman easily as long as you dodge and never
hit him in the face twice in a row.


Sent in by Casey Lemons:
This one is for Sandman. It is a little hard to pull off but is by
far the easiest way to beat him. Whenever he gets through throwing
jabs for however long it is start by throwing a punch to his face.
This will cause him to block and counter punch. If you are slow
you will get rocked but if you are quick enough then you can dodge
his counter and lay way to him the normal way. Just repeat the
process and you will be able to knock him down in around the first
round. Also if he blocks with no counter be ready for his
three uppercuts.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
World Circuit Champion: Super Macho Man (Title bout, must KO or TKO)

Did you notice Super Macho Man's mugshot before the match? His hair is
grey. But when you start the fight, he will have black hair. Weird eh

Super Macho Man will fight like Popinski, except for a different
special attack. He starts with uppercuts which you get 6 hits if you
dodge. You also get 4 for each dodged hook. If he stops punching for a
while, then watch him until he vibrates, as this signals a spin punch
that can knock you off your feet if not dodged. Every time you knock
him down, he will back up, flash, then throw a ton of spin punches.
Once you get the rythim of dodging, you will be able to get a lot of
hits on him. When you beat him, you will be the new world champ.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dream Fight

What to expect: You are going to be up against Mr. Dream, he is your
last opponent in this game. He is very hard so you better be able to
block and dodge. Also, when he knocks you down, then just get up at 9.
This will give you more stamina when you get up, and give you a better
chance at beating him.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Legendary: Mr. Dream (5000 Points needed)

The first round is fairly easy to survive, but you can get only 2
punches in when you stun him. Until the clock hits a minute
and a half, he will do nothing but uppercuts. If these are not dodged,
you will be knocked down in 1 hit. If you can survive this half of the
round, he will stop with the uppercuts and do winking jabs. Just dodge
these and quickly counter punch until the round ends.

The second round is a little harder. He jabs until you lose all of
the hearts you have, and then does a winking jab. After this, he
will do 2 uppercuts in a row. Just dodge and counter punch. You
can punch 6 times when you dodge an uppercut, maybe 4 more if you're
fast enough. Should he happen to raise his gloves and blink his
eyes, punch him in the stomach. You will either get a star, or
knock him down, depending on your luck. Maybe punching a second
or 2 later helps with bringing him down. Be careful though, since
he does a piston rush sort of thing after you hit him, or take
too long to hit him. The remainder of the round is mostly winking
jabs and an occasional 2 uppercuts when he pauses for a second.
On to the third round. Unless you beat him already...

The third round is basically the same as the second round.
He won't start with jabs though. When he pauses before doing 2
uppercuts, keep in mind that he may switch up and do 2 jabs instead.
Just as long as you keep on dodging and punching, you should
emerge victorious.

Beating Mr. Dream Involves luck too, so if you lose, just try again.
You never know, you might just get lucky.
