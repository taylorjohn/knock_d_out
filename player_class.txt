The Player needs to store the following information and also save and reload a saved game.

I am going to create a dictionary and use repr()/eval() to convert to string and from string:

data = {
    "PLAYER":Lil Mac,
    "LOCATION": Bronx, NY
    "AGE": 13
    "WEIGHT": 107
    "WINS": 0
    "LOSSES": 0
    "KOs": 0
    "RANKED": 13
    "HEARTS": 0
    "STARS": 0
    "STAMINA": 100
}

with open("data1.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as file:
   file.write(repr(data))
file.close()

Then to load:

with open("data1.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
   data_string = file.readline()
   data = eval(data_string)
   print data["PLAYER"]
file.close()



This info does not change

PLAYERNAME = Lil Mac
LOCATION = Bronx, NY
AGE = 13
WEIGHT = 107

This Player info changes

WINS = 0
LOSSES= 0
KOs = 0
RANKED = 13
HEARTS = 0
STARS = 0
STAMINA = 100

WINS = 0
when the player wins a match it adds 1 to WINS TOTAL

LOSSES= 0
when the player wins a match it adds 1 to LOSSES TOTAL
